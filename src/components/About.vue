        <div>Yo! I'm <span>Pam</span>, a web developer who's been coding for a little over a year now. I fell in love with
          building stuff online and haven't looked back since.</div>
        <div>I'm all about front-end development, where I turn design ideas into living, breathing websites. I don't just
          make them work, I make them look good too. My mission is to create interfaces that are a breeze to use and stick
          in people's minds.</div>
